some_proc:
    mrmovl   4(%esp), %ecx
    mrmovl   8(%esp), %edx
    mrmovl   12(%esp), %ebx

LOOP:
    mrmovl   0(%ecx), %edi
    mrmovl   0(%edx), %eax
    addl     %eax, %edi
    rmmovl   %edi, 0(%edx)
    iaddl    $4, %ecx
    iaddl    $4, %edx
    iaddl    $-1, %ebx
    jne      LOOP

    ret


Here are the identified true data dependencies:

%ecx is read after it is written in the some_proc function.
%edx is read after it is written in the some_proc function.
%eax is read after it is written in the LOOP.
%edi is read after it is written in the LOOP.
Now, let's proceed with the pipeline diagram from cycle t through t + 16. We'll assume that the mrmovl 0(%ecx), %edi instruction is in the Fetch stage at cycle t.

For clarity, I'll present the pipeline stages:

Fetch (F)
Decode (D)
Execute (E)
Memory (M)
Write Back (W)
Here's the timeline:

Cycle t: Fetch mrmovl 0(%ecx), %edi (F)
Cycle t + 1: Decode mrmovl 0(%ecx), %edi (D)
Cycle t + 2: Execute mrmovl 0(%ecx), %edi (E), Fetch mrmovl 0(%edx), %eax (F)
Cycle t + 3: Memory mrmovl 0(%ecx), %edi (M), Decode mrmovl 0(%edx), %eax (D), Fetch addl %eax, %edi (F)
Cycle t + 4: Write Back mrmovl 0(%ecx), %edi (W), Execute mrmovl 0(%edx), %eax (E), Decode addl %eax, %edi (D), Fetch rmmovl %edi, 0(%edx) (F)
At the end of the t + 4 cycle of execution:

Registers being read: %ecx, %edx, %eax
Registers being written: %edi
This is a basic outline of the pipeline execution. Depending on the pipeline design and hazard handling mechanisms, the actual behavior might vary.
