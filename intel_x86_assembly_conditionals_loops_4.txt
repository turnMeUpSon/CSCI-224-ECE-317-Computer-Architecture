To sum the sequence 1 4 7 10 13 16 19 22 25 28 ..., we need to adjust the increment value for i. We can achieve this by changing the addl instruction for i from addl $1, %ecx to addl $3, %ecx to make it increment by 3 instead of 1.

Copy code
      movl  $0, %eax         # %eax:  sum = 0
      movl  $1, %ecx         # %ecx:  i = 1

      LOOP:
         addl  %ecx, %eax
         addl  $3, %ecx      # Change increment to 3

         cmpl  %edi, %ecx
         jle   LOOP

      LOOP_EXIT:
         ...


To compute the factorial of N, we need to multiply each iteration by the current value of i. We also need to update the conditional jump to check if the value of i is less than or equal to N.

assembly
Copy code
      movl  $0, %eax         # %eax:  sum = 0
      movl  $1, %ecx         # %ecx:  i = 1

      LOOP:
         imull %ecx, %eax    # Multiply sum by i
         addl  $1, %ecx

         cmpl  %edi, %ecx
         jle   LOOP

      LOOP_EXIT:
         ...


To compute the sum of squares from 1 to N, we need to square each iteration and add it to the sum.

assembly
Copy code
      movl  $0, %eax         # %eax:  sum = 0
      movl  $1, %ecx         # %ecx:  i = 1

      LOOP:
         movl  %ecx, %edx    # Copy i to %edx
         imull %edx, %edx    # Square i
         addl  %edx, %eax    # Add square to sum
         addl  $1, %ecx

         cmpl  %edi, %ecx
         jle   LOOP

      LOOP_EXIT:
         ...


To generate the sum -1 + 2 - 3 + 4 - 5 + 6 - 7 + 8 - 9 + ..., we can toggle the sign of each number based on whether it's even or odd. We can achieve this by performing a bitwise AND operation with the number 1 (00000001 in binary) and checking if it's zero or not. If it's zero, the number is even, if it's not zero, the number is odd.

assembly
Copy code
      movl  $0, %eax         # %eax:  sum = 0
      movl  $1, %ecx         # %ecx:  i = 1

      LOOP:
         movl  %ecx, %edx    # Copy i to %edx
         andl  $1, %edx       # Check if i is odd

         testl %edx, %edx    # Test if i is odd
         jz    ADD           # If i is even, jump to ADD

         negl  %ecx           # Negate i if odd
         jmp   ADD_EXIT      # Jump to ADD_EXIT

      ADD:
         addl  %ecx, %eax    # Add i to sum

      ADD_EXIT:
         addl  $1, %ecx

         cmpl  %edi, %ecx
         jle   LOOP

      LOOP_EXIT:
         ...
These changes will modify the behavior of the loop as described.
